Okay.
Hi, everyone.
My name is Zachary Levent Levy.
And with me is Richard Kenney.
We'll do the introduction soon.
Before we start, if you can
just, you know, you can use
the chat, throw your name or
just say hi there and where
you're coming from.
That would be interesting for me
just to know, you know, who
we have here with us.
On the sidebar, there is chat
button.
You can
Press that, say hi.
Don't be shy.
Exactly.
I know you there.
Hi, Alan.
Guatemala, Central America.
That's a first for me, I
think.
And you're Richard.
Yes, I know you're Richard.
Paris.
Nice.
Hi, Pierre.
I think that you've been in
the previous one as well.
We've got Blue Cross, Patrick from
Canada.
We've got Paris, Toronto.
So another guy from Canada.
That's great.
A few other housekeeping stuff.
There's a Q&A button at the
top.
You can use that one.
If you want to ask questions,
it will refer to and answer
in the end.
Or you can use the sidebar
chat as well.
Whenever you ask questions, we'll try
to push them into the session,
especially if they are related.
What I haven't talked about yet
is what we're going to speak.
So as I said, I'm Tachil
Ventlevi.
I'm
Logik.me, okay, and TestRTC.
I write around WebRTC and CPaaS,
Communication Platform as a Service, and
doing a lot of things in
TestRTC around testing, monitoring, and support
services for WebRTC.
Now, the context here is slightly
different.
A few months ago, I started
to create a course in WebRTC
courses around support and WebRTC.
worked on the course, did a
lot of things there, and then
it came the part of dealing
with what can go wrong in
call.
There are different parts that can
go wrong.
One of them is the devices
themselves, and they needed to focus
on what can go wrong with
audio devices.
Well, I was clueless about that
part, and it was suggested to
me to talk to the guys
from Poly about that.
And then I got connected to
Richard Kenny.
Richard, hi.
Hey, yep, that was me.
I spoke to Sahi probably a
couple of weeks ago now, brokered
by our analyst relations team.
And I think after we gave
Sahi the sort of fire hose
of information coming to him about
headsets for a
For a subject that people think,
just plug a headset in, make
it work, put it on, there's
an awful lot to it compared
to that perception.
So hopefully the education that we
gave Sahi a couple of weeks
ago, we're now able to give
to you to make sure that
you'll be able to pick the
right headset for your next WebRTC
session.
Yes.
So I actually created a lesson
on that and placed it in
the course already.
So that was great for me.
So thank you for that.
Now, the thing is that the
two things, first of all, it
was really, I really enjoyed talking
to you.
So, you know, doing that again
was like, let's do that.
Why not?
And the second thing, I learned
so much about headsets that I
didn't know that was actually interesting.
I mean, headsets are quite boring
until you start digging in and
understanding what that means, probably like
any other subject.
So I wanted to have, you
know, that type of a conversation.
So it's like,
There are different issues that I've
seen in the last few years,
especially in the last year, of
different contact center scenarios that simply
broke because of the use of
specific headsets in WebRTC.
And I guess my first question
to you would be, why should
I even care about headsets?
Why not just go pick one
from the store, you know, whatever
works, look at the plug, if
that's the USB one, the PL
one, or whatever I want,
shove it into my machine and
that's it.
What's wrong with that?
I think for you as a
tester, if you're a sort of
developer, probably nothing wrong.
What you probably want is a
really simple, low-featured USB headset.
Very little to go wrong, very
little added features that add DSP
latency on these things.
Brilliant.
For testing purposes, that sort of
thing is perfect.
Plugging your USB cable in, you
know exactly where your audio is
going.
However,
When you then come to roll
your application out into an organization,
when you want to start testing
with different people, you suddenly find
there's a whole world of people
out there that have got very
different needs, very different requirements.
First of all, for many people,
they need convincing that they do
need to use a headset.
What's happening is with the sort
of shift away from people using
classic on-premises, traditional PBXs that had
a phone,
There was no trigger to use
a headset.
Now with the move to WebRTC,
nobody likes staring at their computer
and shouting at a computer, and
more importantly, the computer shouting back
at them, especially when they're in
an open office.
And then you start to look
at, okay, well, where are people
using it?
Have they got a private office?
In which case, okay, nice speakerphone.
Are they doing this on the
train, on the Wi-Fi?
Are they doing this in an
airport?
Do they move regularly as part
of their job?
Are they an intensive phone user
that uses phone calls for twelve
hours a day?
Do they need to use WebRTC
with other devices like mobiles?
So there's so many other different
applications there that, yes, when you
are testing, when you're developing, get
a nice simple headset.
When you need to move away
from that to roll out, you
really do need to take account
of what the users want and
what the users do, because that's
really the biggest influence and that's
what will get your product adopted
once it's developed.
So I'll continue with that new
train of thought and say, well,
you know what?
I want to use AirPods or
Beats.
The big ones.
That's what people go out with
today.
First of all, I'm going to
put up a slide here if
I can.
Let's see if I can get
the screen sharing to work.
Share that screen.
Share.
All right.
So
Beats and AirPods are primarily designed
for listening to music.
And the big problem with applications,
the big reason for developing applications
is speech.
And what people don't realize in
an awful lot of cases is
that there's a huge difference between
speech and music.
The catchphrase for Beats is people
are missing some of the music.
And what they're missing, if you
can see the screen here, is
this area on the left, around
about the hundred Hertz, the fifty
Hertz.
And what that gets you in
music is this big, nice thumping
bass.
So things like, you know, beats
especially are optimized to deliver that
thumping bass.
But as you can see, language,
there is no speech really down
at that particular level.
There's no energy in the speech.
So if you've got a headset
or a pair of headphones,
that are optimized for listening to
music, it's going to deliver a
pretty poor audio experience.
So that's the sort of big
reason for Beats not being used.
Yes, but it seems that Beats
does more.
It does more than language.
It does also music.
Yes, but it's optimized for music.
So when you look at the
frequency response of something like a
Beats headset, it's very heavy around
the sort of fifty to a
hundred hertz.
Now, hopefully, we're going to teach
people a new word today, and
that word is fricatives.
Okay, what's that word?
Fricatives is where the energy of
your speech is, and your energy
of your speech is here in
this sort of two thousand, three
thousand hertz area.
When you make the hard sounds,
that's what really builds the energy
of your sound.
That's what makes speech clear.
And if you've got a headset
that's optimized for speech, it actually
peaks
but this area up here to
make sure that you've got much
more of an ability to hear
speech clearly.
So if I'm an audiophile and
I'm not, thankfully, I'll need two
different headsets, one for my conferences
and one for music.
Or you need an intelligent headset
that knows what it's doing and
can switch between modes.
Oh, okay.
Where do I get that one?
Oh, I know a good headset
vendor.
I actually didn't know that.
Just sort of to continue on
your theme as well,
why do
we need intelligent audio?
If you look at both of
us, we're in home offices.
It's really quiet in the background.
But for anybody else who's on
this call, take a look around
you.
Seventy percent or so of North
Americans are working out of open
plan offices these days, I think
is the statistic.
And
you do have noise pollution in
those offices if they're not managed
well.
And you do need headsets that
can concentrate the audio or enhance
the speech audio and really make
it stand out above background noise.
So again, if you're a developer
in your homeroom, okay, it's fine,
whatever headset, but for that commercial
rollout of your application, get something
that's optimized for speech.
Okay, so
Let's say that I want a
headset, but it's not the one
that I need.
AirPods probably not as well.
So what makes a headset?
You showed me last time what
needs to be there and how.
So there's so many different varieties
of headset.
We can start to look at
this from a category of what
types of headset are there for
people, first of all.
And what we'll do later on
is we'll then sort of come
back and start to look at
what the users are on this
one.
So the headset that most people
are familiar with these days, thanks
to things like AirPods, is Bluetooth
wireless headsets.
Bluetooth is a fantastic technology.
It sort of pervasively works anywhere.
You can use it completely around
the world.
Every single mobile device these days
has got good support.
Even Windows is actually getting good
support for Bluetooth on its devices
these days, eventually.
A really good thing about Bluetooth,
like I said, it can work
anywhere.
It can work on any particular
device.
Then what you then got, the
trouble with Bluetooth is that sometimes
you're sharing the airwaves with people.
Microwave frequencies, wireless LANs, all the
work in those sort of same
frequency bands.
So what we find is that
some people have a preference for
absolute speech audio quality.
They want a band that is
preserved for these audio devices, which
is where this technology DECT comes
in.
So again, you get all those
benefits of mobility, the freedom to
move around, but you've got a
reserved audio channel just for your
headset.
What you can then get into
is corded headsets.
So people who don't want the
hassle of charging up batteries every
day, people who want to know
exactly where their audio is going,
they plug it in, it works.
It's a whole range of devices
here that you've got to go
from.
Yep, I see a cord.
You know, these devices plug in,
they'll work on any device out
there.
These are sort of more for
office users, occasional users.
What you can then move up
to is these real intensive devices.
This is the range that we
promote for contact centers.
People who are on the phone
eight to twelve hours a day
intensively, very little breaks between them.
And it's a really intensive environment
for the devices.
What would be the difference between
these two, the corded and the
corded intensive?
So hold up a cable here.
What happens on a daily basis
is that people fold up their
headsets, they put them away.
And when they fold them up,
they bend, they flex the cable,
they twist the cable around.
They also sit there every day
and they might play with the
cable or they wrap it around.
So with an intensive headset, we
designed those headsets to last five
years.
And we think that for an
intensive usage, somebody will bend that
cable ten times a day.
So we know that over the
life of the headset, it's got
to last, I don't know, fifty,
a hundred thousand times.
For the standard corded headsets, we
think that they'll be just doing
that once a day.
They'll be picked up, moved around
once, put down again, and that's
really it.
But again, we want it to
last five years, but this time
it's only going to last twenty
thousand, for example.
Those aren't real figures, but they're
just the relative
differences is what's correct.
So those corded intensive users are
designed to be used almost twenty
four seven in tough environments.
OK, and then there is a
speakerphone, which isn't a headset.
It isn't a headset, but interestingly,
it's a very good way of
getting people to adopt communications
technologies.
So there are still people out
there with their corner offices and
it's ideal for them.
But also what you're increasingly seeing
in enterprises is the huddle room.
Um, rather than a meeting room
that people book out and very
rarely use, this is a huddle
room with audio and video technology
and people walk in there.
They'll bring their laptop with them.
And you know, there's multiple people
in the room and you can't
have multiple people on the same
So just putting a speakerphone in
each of these huddle rooms gives
you the ability to do, um,
audio conferences with groups of people
really easily.
Now for me, I work from
home a lot.
Um,
So, and I do these types
of conferences and calls with clients,
you know, vendors, people, whatever.
I'm probably two or three hours
a day on video calls, similar
to this one.
Which headset should I use?
So sort of really, it depends
on, do you have any other
devices?
Do you use mobile phone?
Do you talk on the phone?
Do you do conferences while you're
traveling, for example?
So I hate doing calls on
my phone because I don't have
Hence, I don't use there, which
is to answer your question how
I work.
And then I have a laptop
where I never connect the headset.
And if I use that for
calls, it's only while traveling and
then probably only from a hotel
room.
So it almost sounds like you
need a briefcase of headsets to
take with you, potentially.
But I'd recommend starting point is
the headset that I'm wearing now.
This is a Voyager.
It's a Bluetooth headset.
So it's paired up to my
mobile whenever I need to make
phone calls on the mobile if
I'm traveling.
It's also paired through a dongle
into my PC.
So I haven't used a phone
on my desk for years, but
I use extensively collaboration apps, multiple
meeting apps, along with my mobile.
Rather than AirPods, which are tucked
right up here, this has got
a highly active microphone on it
to cancel background noise so that
if I'm traveling, you don't hear
the train noise, you don't hear
the airport noise when I'm talking.
That sounds ideal for you.
Let's start with a dongle, though.
Why do you need a dongle?
You said it connects to Windows
just fine.
What we found with
uh windows is that the bluetooth
um is patchy there's a fairly
recent um rollout i think at
the window one of the latest
windows creators updates where applications are
slowly now starting to recognize bluetooth
so yes i might be able
to pair my headset to the
laptop but on the majority of
windows devices out there the applications
don't look for that embedded bluetooth
as an audio source or an
audio sync.
So what the dongle does is
it shows up as a sound
card and says, okay, I'm a
sound card, just feed your audio
to me.
And that way it just takes
all the compatibility concerns away from
IT managers that are rolling this
out.
Okay, that was one.
The second one, you've talked about
this part of the headset.
Sorry for my bad English.
boom this is the boom okay
so they you know what people
tended to find in the early
days of headsets is they kind
of wanted them to look like
headphones so we put microphones up
in here and but what we
found then is that increasingly as
people moved into web rtc environments
software environments we had to do
a lot of dsp processing to
make the headset pick up the
voice
And a lot of DSP processing
potentially adds latency.
The better solution is to physically
put the microphone as close to
your mouth as possible.
That way you get rid of
any need for processing and you
sort of physically cancel out the
background noise.
So yours is perfectly positioned as
you'd expect for someone that's talked
to us for a while.
Just off the corner of the
mouth, microphone is right there.
And that way you're giving a
nice low latency solution for these
WebRTC applications.
and you're able to cancel out
a lot of the background noise
that's around you.
Okay, so there is a lot
to do.
You told me last time again
that the size of the head,
the length of the microphone, all
of these things that if I'm
in a contact center and I
need to purchase like a hundred
or two hundred of these, I
need to have variety for different
types of people physically to meet
their needs.
No, you don't need to variety.
What we do in our headsets
is we effectively build or design
that variety in for you.
So the headset on the screen
here, the corded intensive variant, you've
got seven different adjustability dimensions on
this one.
And what that does is that
for somebody with a huge head
like me, I expand it to
its maximum levels.
It fits on my ears perfectly.
It puts the microphone in front
of my mouth.
Someone with a smaller head, they
just close all those adjustments up
and it fits them perfectly as
There was a variety in the
fact that you showed me also
headsets that have only one side,
like, you know, only on one
ear.
Yeah.
So the DECT wireless one here,
for example, has one ear.
What we find there is it's
almost a user preference.
If your work is...
predominantly telephony, so you don't do
any multimedia work or any webinars,
and you've got a nice quiet
office, then people like one ear
because they like to hear a
little bit about what's going on
around them.
If you work in an open
plan office with people that are
noisy, if you've seen our marketing
material, the ferrets, the keyboard smashers,
all those sort of things in
the background, you probably want two
earpieces.
Also, if your headset is doing
shared duty, if it does telephony
and if it does multimedia work,
music, webinars, training, videos, you want
a headset that's got two ears
to take full account of the
stereo.
And there's a different, again, last
time it was don't use Beats
because they are too big on
the ear.
That was like from the makeup
point of view.
A little bit, yeah.
Again, it depends on how people
are using the headset.
Beats, and we sell these headsets
as well.
There's headsets that are physically big
on the ear.
And what they do is they
seal around the ear and they
provide a very good sort of
physical passive noise canceling.
You can pair that up with
active noise canceling that takes away
some of the higher frequencies.
But the big headset on the
ear is really not designed to
be worn all day.
What you find is there's a
lot of heat buildup.
because it seals around your ear.
There's a lot of heat buildup
and people find it uncomfortable after
a while.
Um, you know, if you look
at some of these other headsets
there, there's smaller ear cushions.
Some of the ones you see
are actually foam ear cushions because
there's more air circulation there.
And those are the sort of
ones that are more designed to
be worn at that intensive end
of the spectrum of eight, eight
to ten hours.
Now it's funny since you last
talked to me about that, we
had like, it was cold here
in Israel.
And I found myself just leaving
the headsets on after talking to
people just to, you know, get
the heat into my body back.
It works with your hat.
You can keep your hat on
as well, just to keep your
head warm and your ears warm.
And let's go back to corded
versus wireless.
If Bluetooth is such a great
thing, why don't I deploy that
to all of my people in
the contact center?
Well, Bluetooth has had a tricky
relationship with IT people.
When it was first bought out,
it was perceived as being very
insecure.
There's many stories of Bluetooth being
hacked, but that's gone away.
But it still has a little
bit of a reputation.
Is it really secure to use
Bluetooth?
Yes, it is absolutely secure.
What you will find, though, is
that the way that Bluetooth technology
works is it sort of random
frequency hops.
and it can hop onto somebody
else's channel and create a little
bit of interference.
It goes away very quickly, but
because it's got that random approach
to finding the channels, it does
have a limit on the number
of users within one area, a
density limit, effectively.
Because DECT is actively listening in
on the channels, picking the right
one, we find that DECT has
a much greater density potential than
Bluetooth.
What we've also found as well
is because Bluetooth is seen to
be used with mobiles, some people
don't want to give the impression
that it's okay to use a
mobile in a contact center.
They want their employees working on
the phones, talking to customers.
So they want to give them
headsets that don't work with mobiles
deliberately.
Okay, that's interesting.
And there is also the matter
of different latencies, right?
I saw in the AirPods in
the last release, they reduced latency
a bit in the device itself.
Yeah, so again, when you look
at the design of a headset,
like I said, everybody kind of
wants their headset to look small
and discreet.
That's kind of exactly the opposite
of what we want as a
designer of these sort of systems.
As a designer, we want the
microphone right here.
We want the earpieces right here,
nicely covering.
Because that way, the physical characteristics
of the headset do all the
work for us.
If we take away those physical
characteristics, we have to replace them
with DSP activity.
And so with earpods being so
small, they have to have a
fair bit of DSP in them
to do that.
If I kind of, you know,
rough figures here, but a Bluetooth
headset's got about ninety milliseconds of
latency.
Now, those are averages.
Those can depend on, you know,
model to model.
Decked, because decked headsets, like the
one on the screen here again,
the Savvy series, because they're physically
bigger, the microphone's in the right
place, what we're finding there is
that the latencies on those systems
are around about sixty milliseconds.
Mm-hmm.
If we then want to take
it down even further, we come
down to USB corded headsets.
If you're looking at a high
performance headset, it's got a lot
of DSP in it.
It's doing a lot of work.
Maybe it's having to do work
because of adding acoustic protection for
intensive users.
It's about forty five milliseconds there.
But the sort of entry level
USB headset with minimal DSP work
on it is about thirty milliseconds
So there's quite a spread across
the different product types.
And those are all averages.
we've, I said sort of a
little bit of a standard here
of the TIA nine, the old
telecom standard.
Um, but generally we're finding that
those figures are, are perfectly within
the bounds of application design for
developers.
Well, as long as we've done
everything else, you know, well on
the other side of where they
see, but yes, but, and again,
sometimes we do find that headsets
are sometimes the sticking plaster that
goes on the end.
If people leave them to the
last minute,
if they're like designed in at
launch day, then yeah, there might
be problems there.
But if you're designing them in
from the very start, you can
build in those characteristics across the
sort of end-to-end part of your
And we didn't talk about the
personas inside the contact center.
So if I'm managing a contact
center of two hundred people and
I decided that I want to
go, let's say I can't do
Bluetooth, that would be fine.
I can't just go and roll
out two hundred
decked wireless headsets of the savvy
series just as an example or
would that make sense yeah um
two hundred um decked wireless headsets
yeah you're gonna have to sort
of probably work with us to
look at the space if you're
fitting them all into a room
this size yeah maybe there's going
to be trouble but if you're
fitting them into a reasonably good
spaced environment if you've got things
like partitions if you've got trees
or foliage in the office at
any point if they're on different
floors yeah there's all sorts of
um
ways to fit those in.
But generally, we'd say that two
hundred people using decked headsets is
eminently possible.
So let's say that I'm Uncle
Scrooge or I want lower latencies,
I would go for corded intensive.
Yep.
For everyone.
And there's nothing wrong with that.
That's the model that the majority
of contact centers have and are
using at the moment.
Um, you know, absolute reliability, um,
these things that, you know, there's
never going to be any concerns
about battery.
There's never going to be concerns
about where your audio is going.
Um, so yeah, people are, people
want to use those corded headsets
Does it make sense to mix
them up?
If you want to, again, let's
just sort of show you a
slide here again.
Most people's image of the contact
center is that it's a big
warehouse full of people all doing
exactly the same job, constantly answering
phones.
To be honest, that's a little
bit outdated these days.
That persona that was called agent
is really in use only in
a lot of the outsourcing areas
where they're there just to make
phone calls.
And it's about quantity rather than
quality.
What we're seeing nowadays is that
easy, simple phone calls
are easy, simple interactions are dealt
with by automated systems, bots, AIs,
chatbots, you name it.
The simple stuff is done that
way or even through self-service.
So the phone call coming into
a contact center now is an
escalation.
Somebody's tried a digital channel.
It hasn't worked.
They're frustrated.
They now make a phone call,
and that's an escalation.
So more these days, customer service
rep is that type of person.
And their focus is on the
quality of the experience, not the
quantity of phone calls they go
through.
So we're starting to see some
of these high-end customer service reps
use wireless.
And in a lot of cases,
we're actually seeing the contact center
supervisor use wireless as well because
they need to walk the floor.
They need to look over their
employee's shoulder and guide them through
a complex interaction.
But they still need to be
available for a phone call.
So we are seeing that mix
of, okay, if you're predominantly at
your desk, yep, okay, corded is
the right headset.
Otherwise, we're probably going to give
you wireless to give you that
mobility to get around the contact
center.
And it's like part of the
fact that the contact center agent
job is changing, right?
It's like we're trying to have
less churn, have them deal with
the
complicated stuff and relegate the easy
stuff towards self-service channels or even
bots?
An example I use of my
own personal experience is that when
I was younger, I had to
ring my bank to find my
bank balance.
I can't imagine doing that these
days.
It's everywhere.
It's on an app, twenty four
seven, whatever I need.
The only reason I call my
bank is a credit card fraud
or unexpected transactions.
And those are longer, more complex
things.
So the person on the other
end
doesn't just have to read information,
read a script, go on to
the next call.
They've now got to solve a
complex problem for me.
And sometimes they can't solve it
themselves.
So they have to work with
other teams.
So all of a sudden now
you've not a sort of single
person, you're working with team collaboration
equipment as well.
And more and more, you're starting
to see people being focused on
customer experience.
Nevermind, did I answer your question
correctly?
It's more about
Did I provide you a really
good experience that you would recommend
to your friends?
So people are now being hired
to deliver that good experience.
So it's a very different role.
I don't like the word agent.
I don't think it does
people in contact centers justice, the
hard work they're doing.
So it's like as an employee
or as a manager in the
contact center, I actually need to
make them happier.
At least satisfied from the job
that you're doing and the way
they're doing it.
Hence, I need to deal with
things like status-based equipment.
One of the real pain points
of contact centers is you ring
in and you're put on hold.
Why on earth should that happen
these days in presence and status
relationships?
Why can't I see who's available,
transfer a call to them because
I know their status rather than
trying to hunt around and speak
to people?
Okay, so let's say I want,
again, I want to go and
shop around for a headset.
What would be the three top
things that I need to care
about or define for me before
I do that purchase?
All right, so first of all,
take a look at who your
users are.
That's the biggest, most important thing
We've been studying this for years,
and we've got a huge database
of user personas.
And actually, we can boil it
down to one, two, three, seven
different personas covering about ninety one
percent of the enterprise workforce.
And once you know those users,
you then start to know what's
the devices they use.
Where do they use those devices?
And really, that's the sort of
starting point that you need to
go to.
and work from, um, you know,
then you sort of start to
look at, okay, what application am
I using?
So where, where is that application
going to be used?
Is it going to be used
on a PC?
Am I still going to be
making people use desk phones or
is my employee workforce completely mobile?
So those are probably the first
two things that I'd, I'd focus
on.
Um, and that would probably get
you about at the way there
to choosing your devices.
Anything that I didn't ask and
should have asked?
Let's have a little look through
some of these things.
So just sort of one point
on the contact center application is
the idea that
there's a couple
of ideas there, really.
And again, it might sort of
change the device you use and
you look at for future things.
It's that
And traditionally, what we've seen is
that most people, most organizations start
off with a call center.
They have a phone call coming
into them.
They expand that to become a
contact center.
They do social media, et cetera,
et cetera.
But what we're finding now is
that most people have a really
high satisfaction rating when it comes
to voice.
People actually get the answers that
they want from a voice conversation.
They're not so satisfied with those
digital channels.
But there's a new channel coming
through that is starting to supersede
satisfaction when it comes to interactions.
And that's video.
All of a sudden, we're seeing,
I suppose the UK might be
typical, they're seeing the high streets
change into different environments.
Banks are moving off the high
street.
So if I want a mortgage,
nowadays, I'm more likely to do
it online as a video interaction
rather than go into a physical
bank.
start your thinking off now of
okay what's the right audio device
but don't forget the video devices
video for customer interactions for internal
interactions is going to become so
much more important in the future
you already see it in the
demographics of anyone under twenty one
they they hold their phone like
this they'll answer it like this
it's in front of their screen
I can never get my kids
to call me by voice
They will only do a video
call over WhatsApp, and for them,
that's a call.
Because that's what their expectation of
a call is.
Exactly right.
So it's a small niche at
the moment in contact centers, especially.
It's getting much bigger in enterprises,
but it will become much bigger
for that external integration with companies
So we have one question here
that came to us from Ruben.
What headset do you recommend for
Windows, Mac, and Linux users?
Okay, depends on what you want
to use that headset for.
Again, go back and look at
the personas.
Start off with your personas to
get the right type of device
first.
Now, what we're finding is that
on, let's look at the question,
scroll up a minute.
Windows and Mac, they're pretty mature
environments now.
Things like Skype for Business, things
like Zoom, they all work well
on Windows and Mac.
And because they're mature,
We find developers are used to
using them, used to working with
them, etc.
And that way they know what
applications to develop to exchange information
with peripherals.
So any headset that we've got
works really well on Windows and
Mac.
I don't think we're there yet
on Linux because the applications on
there aren't so mature.
What I can say, though, is
if you take one of our
USB headsets, plug it in, it
will always work as an audio
What you've then got to do
is see, okay, how you go
next to that hook switch control,
volume control, all of those sort
of things.
So I guess what I had
in the past, I actually used
Linux and I've moved to Windows
because of something unrelated to Linux.
And USB headset always worked there.
And I used WebRTC on Chrome.
So it's the same question, I
guess, with Chromebooks.
I guess that a lot of
contact centers are start switching to
things like a Chromebook device.
They're not actually.
Only about twenty five percent of
contact centers have shifted to cloud.
I don't want to conflate cloud
with software.
It's not entirely true, but we
do still see that Windows is
the most prevalent.
There's a couple of cutting edge
examples where people are using a
thin client, a Chromebook or those
sort of devices, but they are
actually quite rare still.
excuse me, the bulk of contact
center applications are on-premises, phone on
the desk.
Okay, another question here.
I work remotely, but I'm a
trainer.
I use a laptop, phone, and
mobile and need something with great
audio, but also a very clear
microphone for presenting webinars and
recording
videos.
Any suggestions?
Yeah, let's just move that slide
on there.
This one here, the Savvy Range.
what this gives you is a
connection, a physical connection to a
USB.
So for PC connection, physical connection
to a phone, and then your
Bluetooth mobile will pair with the
base.
So you've got a connection to
all of them and you're able
to use it for any, any
connection, mobile calls, PC calls, desk
phone calls, all of them plus
web presenting.
So that savvy connection,
Eighty two forty five, for example,
is a perfect device for that
particular application.
So this device, the seven ones
also have Bluetooth in them on
the base.
What you do is you don't
pair the headset to the mobile.
You pair the base to the
mobile and then it still uses
the DEC frequencies to go from
the base to the headset.
And so that's nice.
I go from headset to base
with DECT and from base to
phone with Bluetooth.
So you can leave your phone
on your desk at home, walk
downstairs to the kettle to get
a cup of tea on, everything
works.
That's neat.
It gives me twice the range
if I walk with that out
of the way and then continue
walking.
The big problem with using Bluetooth,
for example, is that very few
desk phones support Bluetooth.
There's some other real high-end examples
that you can pair a mobile
headset directly to, but we don't
see that very often.
So that's what I'd recommend is
that Savvy series for that application.
Okay, I see a question from
Pablo.
Does a speakerphone prevent echo in
a web conference?
A laptop mic speaker, for example,
causes terrible echo.
Yes, it does.
All of ours have got a
lot of that application built into
it.
With a laptop, you're generally not
expecting it to do speaking and
listening at the same time.
People think, okay, it's mostly there
for broadcasting.
So we don't see laptop design
being particularly good for web conference.
I do actually say that the
latest Macs are pretty good at
doing that sort of thing.
They seem to have that expectation
built in, but for the majority
of windows-based PCs, no, they're awful.
But speaker phones solve that completely.
Yes, I did.
We did.
When I worked at the Rad
Vision about ten years ago or
twelve, we did a project with
Samsung.
on an LCD display that had,
you know, not WebRTC, but had
video conferencing inside with a camera
and everything in there.
And after the first design, they
found that they had an issue.
So the first hardware design comes
There is an awful lot of
noise.
And the reason was that the
microphone was placed too close to
the fan inside the screen.
Okay, so yeah.
I guess it's the same with
a laptop.
It's a small crowded space to
put everything inside it.
Yeah, and also you're dealing with
the idea of somebody thumping the
keys on a regular basis as
well, which you don't get.
Speaker phones, we know that they're
going to be used for conferences.
We can build the DSP into
it to separate the speaking and
the microphone nice and easily.
Okay, let's see.
Why not use a speaker phone
instead of headset?
That I can answer.
Speaker phone is external.
Now, once it is external, there
are...
developer or as an IT manager,
I need to maintain two separate
stacks or deal with two separate
devices.
So that's one problem.
I hope that answers your question,
The other one is if I'm
going to use an external device,
I need to somehow pair that
to the experience on the laptop,
especially if this is a contact
center with a CRM.
WebRTC allows me to do everything
within the same device, which is
the PC.
inside the browser, inside the CRM
itself.
So there is no need to
go elsewhere.
And as an IT manager, I
have less moving parts, which means
less work to do on my
daily job.
So it's easier to scale up.
I think also looking at it
from the end user point of
view, most people are working in
open offices.
I don't want to sit next
to somebody and listen into their
It's incredibly frustrating.
That's true.
Can I sort of back up
some questions?
There's a couple in there that
we can have a look at
answering.
So Michael McCready's using the Voyager,
sixty two hundred from Plantronics, or
as we're now called.
For those of you on the
video, that's this device here.
It sits as a halo around
the neck and then you've got
your earbuds here to listen in.
Fantastic headset.
But as you say, occasionally wearing
a collared shirt does sit with
I tend to find that I
put it above the collars.
If you have a look at
any picture of our CEO, Joe
Burton, he's always wearing one of
these.
So yes, it can do.
Don't put it underneath, put it
over the top of it so
it sits there nice and comfortably.
Love these headsets.
What they do is they're great.
They vibrate when they ring.
So at the moment, I've got
to keep this headset on to
know when my phone's ringing.
With this one, it vibrates around
my neck.
I can put it in and
answer the phone call.
There we go.
Is there a wired... Stop writing.
I can't read the questions.
Is there a wired budget headset
recommended for teachers teaching online?
Yeah, I would go for one
of our Blackwire range, the middle
on the screen there.
There's a few entry-level versions of
that one that will give you
all of the quality that you've
come to expect from Poly.
So as a teacher, you can't
be missing your students.
You don't want a headset to
be going wrong.
So I would recommend having a
look at the entry versions of
those Blackwire series online.
Question from Pierre Corded.
USB or mini jack when plugged
to a computer?
I guess you need to start
by explaining what a mini jack
is.
I'm guessing that a mini jack
is either the four pole three
and a half mil connector that
you get on Macs and new
PCs or the good old twin
three and a half mil plugs
that we used to get on
PCs.
The big problem with both of
those designs is they are audio
only.
So if all you want to
do is have an audio device
and you're going to answer your
calls on the screen or do
all of your controls on screen,
brilliant.
Mini jack connectors are low latency,
low power consumption.
To be honest, these days you'll
probably struggle to find a headset
that's got a mini jack connector
on it.
But if you want any form
of managing the headset, if you
want any form of
interaction between an application and a
headset so for example if i
press my mute button now it
will sync with the any meeting
app that we're using on screen
all of that because we're doing
it through usb so you know
if you're doing anything other than
pure basic audio go down the
route of usb okay i guess
we have the last question now
um cost wise is a poly
wireless headset
or speakerphone more cost-effective for remote
user while not keeping them wired?
I'll be honest, I don't know.
There's such a broad range of
prices on all of these devices
that we can satisfy any particular
budget for either of those.
Go back to what your user
wants and what they need in
an application first and start from
Generally, I think you'll probably find
that there's parity between the headsets
and the speakerphones when you look
at all the different items that
we've got in the range.
I've grown up, I've worked with
Plantronics and AirPoly for seventeen years,
so I'll always choose a headset
over a speakerphone.
So that would be my recommendation
and preference.
But I know there's people that
don't want to wear them and
will only use them.
So go back to your users,
look at where they're going to
use the devices, look at what
they're going to use them for.
So speakerphone, to be honest, is
absolutely awful for listening to music.
These headsets are so much better.
And would you go, as someone
that lives with headsets, would you
go with a corded or wireless
one?
My preference is wireless, but that's
because I get to choose from
every single thing in our portfolio.
What I find is that if
I am traveling and if I
don't know whether I will get
good access to charging or any
of those sort of things,
I might well switch over to
a corded one.
That's sort of absolute guarantee of
audio.
In the past as well for
webinars, I've always used corded for
webinars just because I know I
can absolutely trust it and there's
no interference, no battery's going to
be wrong.
But I kind of get in
the, I've lost my charging anxiety
over that now.
So it's kind of, they are
now good enough to replace corded
in most scenarios.
The obvious thing is that if
you are using them, I think
this one's got about a fourteen,
fifteen hour battery time on it.
So if I'm flying to Australia,
I might probably have to consider
going to a corded version or
one of our different ones.
Pablo, send us your credit card
details.
We'll make sure that everybody gets
So Richard, I'd like to thank
you a lot.
It was very interesting for me
again.
I learned new things from our
last conversation.
So really, thank you for doing
that with me.
I really enjoyed the webinar.
Yeah, and thank you for having
us on board, Sahil, and thank
you for everybody else for your
time today as well.
Thanks, everyone.
Bye.
