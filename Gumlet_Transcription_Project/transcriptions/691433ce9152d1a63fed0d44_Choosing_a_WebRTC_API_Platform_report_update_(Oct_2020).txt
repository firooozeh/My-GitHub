Hi there, I'm Tzachi, for those
who don't know me.
I've been working in the past
few weeks on the update to
my report, choosing a WebRTC API
platform.
And I've been looking at different
vendors and recently, or this weekend,
I worked on this slide that
goes and shows the changes in
the market.
The companies, the vendors that have
exited the market of providing APIs
in WebRTC for vendors or for
developers and those that have entered.
And there are three distinct groups.
There is the one that left,
like CafeX, that practically dropped their
API platform, focusing elsewhere.
Circuit did the same, with BitSix,
never responded to my request for
the last two months from different
ways, so I'm assuming they're half
dead.
And Phoenix, which were never meant
to be there.
They're focused on broadcast and less
in developer APIs for interactive
communications.
We've got this group here, these
six vendors.
These vendors are actually vendors that
got acquired in the last year
and a half.
So you've got Candy, got acquired
by Avitek.
API RTC by AppEasy.
AppEasy got acquired by Kayo a
month or two ago, I think.
OnSip was just acquired by Intrado.
Dolby or Dolby.io acquired Voxit in
the last round and then renamed
that as Dolby.io and created a
new API platform with them.
Happy Days were first acquired by
VoIP Innovations and VoIP Innovations got
acquired now by Sangoma.
Video acquired by Endhouse, shifting focus
a bit from cloud to on-premise
solutions, including for developers.
Now we have new entrants and
the interesting ones are probably AWS
and Azure.
AWS with their QIIME SDK and
Azure with their communication services that
is just booted for preview now.
Eight by Eight came with Jitsi
as a service.
They took Jitsi the open source
or Meet Jitsi the service and
now made it a platform for
developers, brand new from this month.
Bandwidth, joining the CPaaS WebRTC vendors
with voice services that run on
top of WebRTC.
Daily pivoting towards APIs earlier this
year, have a platform of their
own with multiple interesting customers using
Zynkle already.
EnableX coming from India into the
SIPA space, both on-prem and cloud
solutions.
And LiveSwitch, this one is a
service that was released just now
by Frozen Mountain.
We had LiveSwitch as an MCUS-FU
hybrid that you can install and
build on your own, coming now
with LiveSwitch Cloud, a solution for
developers managed and hosted in the
cloud.
So there are a lot of
things moving around in this domain.
And in the update that is
coming up later this week or
at the beginning of next week,
I need to see how that
turns out to me, there are
going to be a lot of
changes.
The first part talks about WebRTC
development, development practices, different
approaches to
developing with WebRTC.
Then towards the vendors and the
CPaaS platforms, what are the different
KPIs and feature sets that we
look for.
how you select a vendor versus
another.
And then there's a four-pager for
each and every one of these
vendors.
In this round, Agora is sponsoring
the report, which means that their
four-pager is going to be available
publicly as part of the report
or separate from the report next
to it.
If you want to learn more

Thank you.
